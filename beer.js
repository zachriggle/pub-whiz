This time, though, we tipped the scales in favour of beer, adding to the Duchessa wort only a 25% of wine must: in this case we used Malvasia (coming from our friends of Tenuta di Bibbiano, as usual), a white, aromatic grape variety which gives the beer a gentle and nice sharpness and an inusual, fruity nose. The beer is bottle-fermentd using Champagne-yeasts, and it has a quite intense \u0093perlage\u0094 (bubbles) that makes it perfect as an aperitif or even for the whole meal. The \u0093chaotic\u0094 label was designed by Valentina De Luca, an Art student at the Istituto d\u0092Istruzione Superiore Antonio Cederna of Velletri (Rome), who won our contest \u0093Etichette Bizzarre\u0094.",

Yet, by inviting Kyle Hollingsworth, keyboardist for eclectic, jam-prone sextet, The String Cheese Incident, and Keri Kelli, wailing rock guitarist of Alice Cooper fame, we were able to make truly beautiful music. Turns out, these musicians have a great deal in common, both with each other and with Stone. We all enjoy turning things up to 11, and that is represented in this collaborative offering, an imperial India pale ale ably backed by Nugget, Comet and Calypso hops, and amplified care of a healthy dry-hopping with Vic\u0092s Secret, a new Australian hop, adding citrus and tropical fruit oomph. To give this modern masterpiece some soulful, classic character, we traced the roots of brewing to the days when Old World herbs were used to spice beers, adding in coriander and, a first for us, elderberries. To stand up to that sumptuous spice and blaring bitterness, we added golden naked oats, which are lightly roasted and add body and enhanced mouthfeel to the brew like a steady, unbreakable backbeat to an incendiary jam solo. Sit back, crank the volume and get lost in this operatic incarnation of genres combined in the name of invention.",

The wort boiling phase is prolonged in this case to obtain a certain caramelizing of the sugars in the wort. Strong, full-bodied and mellow, its marked yet well-balanced malt flavor mainly derives from a special bottle-conditioning process that lasts for approximately 4 weeks. Bear in mind that this is not a refermentation phase caused by adjunct sugar or wort, which happens with Trappist beers. It is an exclusive procedure adopted by Birrificio Italiano\u00ae of Lurago Marinone.\r\nThat is why Ambershock\u00ae is only sold in bottles. If it were matured in vats and served on tap, it would have a completely different taste.

One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.
