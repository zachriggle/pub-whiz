Belgian beers use a far broader palette of ingredients (fruits, spices, esoteric yeast strains) than German or English styles. Jeff found the Belgian approach freeing. Upon his return, Jeff created Fat Tire and Abbey Belgian Ale, (assuming Abbey would be his big gun). He and his wife, Kim traveled around sampling their homebrews to the public. Fat Tire\u0092s appeal quickly became evident. People liked everything about it. Except the name. Fat Tire won fans is in its sense of balance: toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness.",

Yet, by inviting Kyle Hollingsworth, keyboardist for eclectic, jam-prone sextet, The String Cheese Incident, and Keri Kelli, wailing rock guitarist of Alice Cooper fame, we were able to make truly beautiful music. Turns out, these musicians have a great deal in common, both with each other and with Stone. We all enjoy turning things up to 11, and that is represented in this collaborative offering, an imperial India pale ale ably backed by Nugget, Comet and Calypso hops, and amplified care of a healthy dry-hopping with Vic\u0092s Secret, a new Australian hop, adding citrus and tropical fruit oomph. To give this modern masterpiece some soulful, classic character, we traced the roots of brewing to the days when Old World herbs were used to spice beers, adding in coriander and, a first for us, elderberries. To stand up to that sumptuous spice and blaring bitterness, we added golden naked oats, which are lightly roasted and add body and enhanced mouthfeel to the brew like a steady, unbreakable backbeat to an incendiary jam solo. Sit back, crank the volume and get lost in this operatic incarnation of genres combined in the name of invention.",

        "description": "\"I really wanted to do something special for our 1000th batch at the original brewpub.  Goose Island could have thrown a party.  But we did something better.  We brewed a beer.  A really big batch of stout-so big the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun.  After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.  People have even said that it\u0092s a great cigar beer, but I haven\u0092t yet tried a cigar that would stand up to it.\"  Brewmaster Greg Hall;   \r\n",

The raspberries are balanced by UFO Hefeweizen\u0092s clean, wheat beer taste, making this beer enjoyable and refreshing.",

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn\u0092t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 10% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness. \r\nColumbus in early and mid kettle.",

Anyone who wanted to brew a beer could, and the winning beer would be determined by popular vote based on a blind sampling at our annual company outing at our brewery in Windsor, VT. The first year there were about a dozen entries from Harpooners in every department. In 2013 there were more than 30. The winning beer is now brewed as a 100 Barrel Series offering. So, after a heated contest, Harpoon Citra Victorious, brewed by Merrill Allen, Jessie Cox, Shannon Cudmore, Liz Melby, and Carolyn Orth, under the guidance of brewers Charlie Cummings and Brian Martyniak, came out\u0085well, victorious.

We added sweet, white peaches to kick off barrel fermentation and give the beer a unique balance. 55% of the grain bill comes from wheat harvested locally in Snow Hill, MD. The use of the locally malted wheat gives the beer a full mouth finish while the bourbon barrels add a touch of the unusual.

With two-row German malts and a well-balanced combination of whole flower Citra, Chinook, Simcoe and Mosaic hops, this 8.7% abv brew blends the powerful citrus aroma and fruity flavors, with the piney, earthy and mildly floral characteristics found in these intriguing hop varieties. Replacing Victory\u0092s Hop Wallop\u00ae Ale, which will take a hiatus from the market for the time being, DirtWolf Double IPA will launch the brewery\u0092s entry into four-packs when it begins to hit markets in October\".\r\n\u0093So a wolf and a prospector walked into a bar\u0085,\u0094 joked President and Brewmaster, Bill Covaleski. \u0093No, in all seriousness, Hop Wallop will be missed, but isn\u0092t necessarily gone forever. We developed that brand 10 years ago as our flavorful response to the hop-bomb vogue of the time. But as brewers who enjoy experimenting with beer styles and ingredient varieties, we looked for the opportunity to do other interesting recipes as time passed. Making the decision to put Hop Wallop aside for a few years allows us to bring this delicious new double IPA, DirtWolf, to the market in bottles.",

        "description": "In The beginning, there were ales. As far as anyone knows, the first beers made were \u0092top-fermented\u0092, which is longhand for \u0092Ale\u0092. Sometime long before the 1860\u0092s, beers became popular that were made in Northern Europe with a bottom fermenting yeast strain that liked the colder temperatures. Because they had to spend weeks aging before they tasted their best, they were known as \u0092Lager\u0092 beer. Lager is the German word for \u0092storage\u0092. Since they had to sit a while, they took up more time and space and as such were harder and more expensive to make. Where ales are meaty, lagers are sinewy. Where ales are street, lagers are \u0092haute couture\u0092. Where an ale might hit you over the head and take your wallet, lagers donate to charity and adopt stray cats. While an ale might steal your car or try to date your daughter and keep her out all night for who-knows-what purpose, a well bred lager would offer to clean your house while you\u0092re on vacation and leave fresh scones and coffee for you when you return. Now, don\u0092t get us wrong, ales can be a lot of fun to hang out with when you\u0092re in the right mood, and if you have bail money on you. But what\u0092s wrong with livin\u0092 uptown from time to time, on a nice street, where the doormen all wear those little uniforms, the air smells of flowers, and lagers rule the Earth. Cheers",

Gently rousing the yeast that settles in the bottle will result in a fuller texture and a more cloudy white appearance. The citrus aromas that jump from the glass are largely tangerine up front with other types of citrus notes that mingle with the Belgian yeast esters. Hop flavors of bitter orange zest dominate the brew and linger to the finish with a nice play of American and Belgian yeast combo.\u0094\r\n\r\nA beer with so many components can be held together with a \u0093Linchpin\u0094. The official \u0093Linchpin\u0094 of this beer is the skillful collaboration between the two breweries to create a unique hop-forward brew.

More info about the fest can be found on the official Flying Dog blog.\r\n\r\nThe beer also appeared on draft at this past weekend\u0092s Gonzofest party. Al from Hop Talk was in attendance and reported on his blog, \u0093I understand it\u0092s made from an augmented Snake Dog wort with an exclusive Belgian yeast strain (called Diablo) and dry-hopped with a load of Amarillo hops. They\u0092re calling it a Belgian IPA. It was really good. It had that hop bite from a big, bad American IPA with the banana and bubblegum from the Belgian yeast.\u0094\r\n\r\nSome may remember a beer called, Raging Bitch Birch Beer, that Flying Dog introduced on April 1st. Whereas that low-gravity series beer was a joke, this beer is anything but at 8% ABV (60 IBU).\r\n\r\nPropaganda from the label: \u0093Two inflammatory words\u0085one wild drink.

Poperinge Golding hops in flowers and a special yeast which makes it a little tart, especially with aging. At the brewery we have excellent cellars which have a constant temperature of 8\u00b0C and allow Oerbier to age at its best. After a couple of years Oerbier tastes like it should have been blended with wine \u0085 Oerbier has been refermented in the bottle and contains a layer of yeast, having vitamins B. NAT en STRAF on the glasses means WET and STRONG, a warning for the 7.5 vol. alcohol content. The little person on the glasses is the Oerbier man, a simple creature who holds a brewers fork in his right hand, symbolizing the work and science, but looking to the other side, the result of all this, the glass of (Oer)beer. The artwork on the poster is a wallpainting found in Spain, (Altamira) and is considered by art lovers as being the best prehistoric art work (30,000 years BC). On the other hand we have Oerbier started in 1980, going on with the tradition.

In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors.\r\n\r\nOur interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops\u0085 \r\n\r\nWhich are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced.\r\n\r\nThe signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aroma\u0085 we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; it\u0092s the mark of the Tiger.",

We bumped up the starting gravity from 20\u00b0 P to 24\u00b0 P. This allowed the beer to finish just over 10% ABV. Like this year\u0092s Barleywine, we\u0092ve decided to play with the hop character, specifically the dry hop presence. Trying to avoid the fiasco of my previous attempt at adding pellets to the fermentor, I did what any good manager would do: I made Charlie add them. He had the advantage of being able to add the hops directly through a top manway and so his besting me in this challenge is not necessarily a sign of his superior brewing skills but more a reflection of my adventurous, try anything spirit (or at least that\u0092s the story I\u0092m stickin\u0092 to). The Charles added 44 lbs of Cascade, split evenly between two batches, or about half a pound per barrel. We then transferred the beer onto seventy-eight pounds of an even mixture of Centennial and Columbus whole flowers, about one pound per barrel. The beer is a little top heavy in terms of the hopping but it seems to be smoothing out a bit as it\u0092s aging. I\u0092d give it six months or so, if you can wait that long.

        "description": "Pumking is an ode to P\u00faca, a creature of Celtic folklore, who is both feared and respected by those who believe in it. P\u00faca is said to waylay travelers throughout the night, tossing them on its back, and providing them the ride of their lives, from which they return forever changed. Brewed in the spirit of All Hallows Eve, a time of the year when spirits can make contact with the physical world and when magic is most potent. Pour Pumking into a goblet and allow it\u0092s alluring spirit to overflow. As spicy aromas present themselves, let it\u0092s deep copper color entrance you as your journey into this mystical brew has just begun. As the first drops touch your tongue a magical spell will bewitch your taste buds making it difficult to escape the Pumking.",

        "description": "Since Day One, we\u0092ve been abundantly forthright and fully transparent about our lust for hops. It\u0092s led us to craft many an IPA, most of them imperial\u0097some intense for their time and all timeless in their intensity. For Stone Go To IPA, we are embracing our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance of lupulin-borne bitterness into a \"session\" IPA delivering all the fruity, piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employed \"hop bursting,\" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness. The result is an Alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the glory of the almighty hop.",

Since we\u0092re plumb out of time and other great name ideas, we\u0092re calling this West Coast hoppy red ale, Red Fish.  Columbus, Chinook and Cascade hops give the beer a robust piney nose.  Two-row, crystal and cara-red malts give the beer a malty background and a 7% abv.",

        "description": "For its third stop on our multi-year trip to explore the state of New Jersey through its beer and culture, Flying Fish journeys to Exit 1 for Bayshore Oyster Stout.\r\n\r\nOysters have had a long association with stout in the United Kingdom. This tradition was gradually lost to the rise of pale ales and overharvesting of the oysters. Exit 1 celebrates this tasty combination and New Jersey\u0092s history as one-time oyster supplier to the nation. Our version is an \"export style\" stout brewed with oysters. The creamy chocolate flavor harmonizes with the minerals from the oyster shells (there\u0092s no actual \"oyster\" taste). An Irish ale yeast contributes a bit of fruitiness and a dry crispness. This richer, fuller stout is perfect for cold weather and to share with friends over great food. Not to mention with a few oysters on the half shell.",
