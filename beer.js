On the schedule is Verloren, and gose.   There aren\u0092t a lot of U.S. brewers making a gose, especially a brewery as large as Boston Beer.  That\u0092s probably why they dubbed it \u0093Verloren\u0094 or \u0093lost\u0094 beer . (It\u0092s Dutch.)  The style originated in Goselar, Germany in the 18th century.   Gose became very popular the adjacent city of Leipzig, Germany due to a lot of local breweries brewing the style.  Gose all but died out during WWII due to brewery closings.   Expect this beer to have a touch of sourness, with notes of lemon &amp; salt.\r\n\r\nA link to the ales of Saxony that had all but vanished, Gose is a peculiar yet captivating brew.  With a base of an unfiltered wheat ale, it\u0092s vivid and refreshing yet also has a softness to it.  The flavor is brought to life by an unexpected touch of salt for a mineral quality, and coriander for a peppery spice.  The result is an unusual and delicate brew that\u0092s full of flavors to discover.
