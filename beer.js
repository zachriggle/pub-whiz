The war years in particular had taken their toll on Mild, reducing its alcohol content.  There had been other changes too. For example, the colour, 1945 X Ale was much darker, brewed from a blend of 5 malts and dark brewing sugar. Wartime shortages also dictated the use of flaked barley. This 1945 Mild contained just a fifth of the hops of 1838 version.  This is Mild as we know it today: a low-gravity, lightly-hopped, dark beer.
