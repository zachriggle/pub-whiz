        "description": "Named in honor of our founder Jeff\u0092s bike trip through Belgium, Fat Tire Amber Ale marks a turning point in the young electrical engineer\u0092s home brewing. Belgian beers use a far broader palette of ingredients (fruits, spices, esoteric yeast strains) than German or English styles. Jeff found the Belgian approach freeing. Upon his return, Jeff created Fat Tire and Abbey Belgian Ale, (assuming Abbey would be his big gun). He and his wife, Kim traveled around sampling their homebrews to the public. Fat Tire\u0092s appeal quickly became evident. People liked everything about it. Except the name. Fat Tire won fans is in its sense of balance: toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness.",

Yet, by inviting Kyle Hollingsworth, keyboardist for eclectic, jam-prone sextet, The String Cheese Incident, and Keri Kelli, wailing rock guitarist of Alice Cooper fame, we were able to make truly beautiful music. Turns out, these musicians have a great deal in common, both with each other and with Stone. We all enjoy turning things up to 11, and that is represented in this collaborative offering, an imperial India pale ale ably backed by Nugget, Comet and Calypso hops, and amplified care of a healthy dry-hopping with Vic\u0092s Secret, a new Australian hop, adding citrus and tropical fruit oomph. To give this modern masterpiece some soulful, classic character, we traced the roots of brewing to the days when Old World herbs were used to spice beers, adding in coriander and, a first for us, elderberries. To stand up to that sumptuous spice and blaring bitterness, we added golden naked oats, which are lightly roasted and add body and enhanced mouthfeel to the brew like a steady, unbreakable backbeat to an incendiary jam solo. Sit back, crank the volume and get lost in this operatic incarnation of genres combined in the name of invention.",

        "description": "\"I really wanted to do something special for our 1000th batch at the original brewpub.  Goose Island could have thrown a party.  But we did something better.  We brewed a beer.  A really big batch of stout-so big the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun.  After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.  People have even said that it\u0092s a great cigar beer, but I haven\u0092t yet tried a cigar that would stand up to it.\"  Brewmaster Greg Hall;   \r\n",

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn\u0092t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 10% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness. \r\nColumbus in early and mid kettle.",

Anyone who wanted to brew a beer could, and the winning beer would be determined by popular vote based on a blind sampling at our annual company outing at our brewery in Windsor, VT. The first year there were about a dozen entries from Harpooners in every department. In 2013 there were more than 30. The winning beer is now brewed as a 100 Barrel Series offering. So, after a heated contest, Harpoon Citra Victorious, brewed by Merrill Allen, Jessie Cox, Shannon Cudmore, Liz Melby, and Carolyn Orth, under the guidance of brewers Charlie Cummings and Brian Martyniak, came out\u0085well, victorious.

With just enough malt character to keep the aggressive hop presence in check, and an unruly 7.5% abv, this brew was seemingly born to kick ass. And RAZE HELL",
